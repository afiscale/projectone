        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>       I'm a self taught web developer. I can thank my friend Eric Mann for inspiring me when I was 13 to start building websites. Back then it was strictly competition. We both built our own websites based on video games we liked at the time. We actually had affiliates and were collecting small amounts of change from ads. I never really thought too much about it then, but I wish I had progressed my skills and continued. Looking back now, the early days of the internet were very archaic with minimal design theory in place.</p>
        <p>       Nowadays, I find myself studying from an array of authors throughout the internet. Starting from classes on udemy, to a tech degree on <a href="http://referrals.trhou.se/aaronfiscale">Teamtreehouse.</a> Go check them out!

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>       Im developing my skills in html and css to be on par with a junior level developer. I have spent a lot of time learning vanilla javascript as I believe this will be the basis for future languages I will learn. With a strong understanding of javascript I will be able to build exciting websites, ultimately to encourage growth for businesses.</p>
